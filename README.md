# Currency Converter

This app is about Finance. You can follow the instant currency values and learn the value against other currencies. The application also gives historical data of selected currencies. Two separate charts are presented to examine this data. Today, since the dollar is accepted as the reserve currency worldwide, the parity of the selected currencies against the dollar in the last 15 days is presented on each chart.
